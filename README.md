###Author: Salvador Alexis Gomez Gonzalez

This project is an R Notebook in which we explain how to make a naive bayes over a dataset.
In this case I use a Generic Data set that has Sex, Height, Foot_size and weigth.
We declare a function to calculate de Probability of X given Z and use it to calculate the probabilities for both men and wemen.
